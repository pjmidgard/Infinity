Algorithm Infinity:

We should take 64 bits and find two the same variations for 0-4 bits long and 0-32 bit, then, save where it is a 3 bits variation, 8 combination and 3 bits variation, 8 combination and find variation should be random. information should move inside on the file. Need to know size of the file.
3-7 the same if Random virision equal reverse. 1 bit compress.
