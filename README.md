Algorithm Infinity:

We should take 64 bits and find two the same variations for 0-4 bits long and 0-32 bit, then, save where it is a 3 bits variation, 8 combination and 3 bits variation, 8 combination. Add one bit next and try to find again if not find that block it's compress and find variation should be random.
